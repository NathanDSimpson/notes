### `<article>` 
element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry.

## `<aside>`
element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.

## `<details>`
creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. A summary or label can be provided using the `<summary>` element.

A disclosure widget is typically presented onscreen using a small triangle which rotates (or twists) to indicate open/closed status, with a label next to the triangle. If the first child of the `<details> `element is a `<summary>`, the contents of the `<summary>` element are used as the label for the disclosure widget.

## `<figure> `
(Figure With Optional Caption) element represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the `(<figcaption>)` element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.

## `<figcaption>`
or Figure Caption element represents a caption or legend describing the rest of the contents of its parent `<figure> `element.

## `<footer>` 
element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.

## `<header>` 
element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.

## `<main>` 
element represents the dominant content of the <body> of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.

## `<mark>` 
The HTML Mark Text element represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes, due to the marked passage's relevance or importance in the enclosing context.

## `<nav> `
element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.

## `<section> `
element represents a standalone section — which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it — contained within an HTML document. Typically, but not always, sections have a heading.

## `<summary>` 
The HTML Disclosure Summary element element specifies a summary, caption, or legend for a `<details>` element's disclosure box. Clicking the `<summary> `element toggles the state of the parent `<details>` element open and closed.

## `<time> `
element represents a specific period in time. It may include the datetime attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.

It may represent one of the following:

- A time on a 24-hour clock.
- A precise date in the Gregorian calendar (with optional time and timezone information).
- A valid time duration.
